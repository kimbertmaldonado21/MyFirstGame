Abstract data type
is a type or class for objects whose behaviour is defined by a set of value and a set of operations. It is called abstract because it gives an implementation-independent view.
Abstract method
 is a method that is declared without an implementation (without braces, and followed by a semicolon), like this: abstract void moveTo(double deltaX, double deltaY);
Analog
Analog is defined as a watch that uses hands moving around the face of the watch to indicate time, rather than digital numbers.
Bandwidth
Bandwidth is the data transfer capacity of a computer network in bits per second (Bps). The term may also be used colloquially to indicate a person's capacity for tasks or deep thoughts at a point in time.
Big data
is a field that treats ways to analyze, systematically extract information from, or otherwise deal with data sets that are too large or complex to be dealt with by traditional data-processing application software.
Cloud storage
Cloud storage is a way for businesses and consumers to save data securely online so that it can be accessed anytime from any location and easily shared with those who are granted permission. Cloud storage also offers a way to back up data to facilitate recovery off-site.
Code
 code is a set of rules or a system of communication, often with randomly assigned numbers and letters given specific meanings. 
Algorithm
a process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations, especially by a computer.
Application
A computer program with an interface, enabling people to use the computer as a tool to accomplish a specific task. Word processing, spreadsheet, and communications software are all examples of applications.
Binary 
Binary is a base-2 number system invented by Gottfried Leibniz that's made up of only two numbers or digits: 0 (zero) and 1 (one). This numbering system is the basis for all binary code, which is used to write digital data such as the computer processor instructions used every day
Bitmap
is a type of memory organization or image file format used to store digital images. 
Bug 
a bug refers to an error, fault or flaw in any computer program or a hardware system. 
Broadband
is the transmission of wide bandwidth data over a high speed internet connection.
Byte
the basic unit of information in computer storage and processing. A byte consists of 8 adjacent binary digits (bits), each of which consists of a 0 or 1.
Backup
In information technology, a backup, or data backup is a copy of computer data taken and stored elsewhere so that it may be used to restore the original after a data loss event. 
Compile
is the creation of an executable program from code written in a compiled programming language.
Computer
computer is an electronic device that manipulates information, or data.
Command
a command is a directive to a computer program to perform a specific task.
Computer program
computer program is a list of instructions that tell a computer what to do. 
Data
data is information that has been translated into a form that is efficient for movement or processing.
Database
database is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system.
Debug
In computer programming and software development, debugging is the process of finding and resolving bugs within computer programs, software, or systems.
Dashboard
a dashboard is a type of user interface which presents information to the user.
Development
Software development refers to a set of computer science activities dedicated to the process of creating, designing, deploying and supporting software
Email
e-mail is a message transmitted and received by computers through a network.
Firewall
firewall is a security device — computer hardware or software — that can help protect your network by filtering traffic and blocking outsiders from gaining unauthorized access to the private data on your computer.
Flowchart
is a diagram of the steps in a process and their sequence. 
Flashdrive
is a small and portable storage device that connects to computers and other devices using a USB Type-A plug that is built onto the drive.
Gigabyte
Gigabyte is 109 or 1,000,000,000 bytes. One gigabyte (abbreviated "GB") is equal to 1,000 megabytes and precedes the terabyte unit of measurement. 
Html
is the set of markup symbols or codes inserted into a file intended for display on the Internet. The markup tells web browsers how to display a web page's words and images.
Hyperlink
 is a word, phrase, or image that you can click on to jump to a new document or a new section within the current document
Interface
interface is a shared boundary across which two or more separate components of a computer system exchange information. 
Internet
Internet is a vast network that connects computers all over the world. 
Java
Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.

logon is the procedure used to get access to an operating system or application,
Logout
Loging out means to end access to a computer system or a website
Malware
Malware is the collective name for a number of malicious software variants, including viruses, ransomware and spyware.
